## _IT'S THE PROFILE FOR_ **bdboogie**

### Hi there I'm John
```markdown
If I ever find a decent photo  I'll added it... dont hold your breath.
```
Most of my life has been spent living in and around Leeds with a brief 3 year stint studying in Newcastle (back in the heady days of Maddisons, Walkers and Ritzys).
Work wise I am currently working remotely as part of  a Product Team providing online services in the finance sector.
I've been around a bit so we wont go in to age but I have three kids all at school with youngest half the age of the eldest, (does that help?).

### Why I'm doing this
I'm curious about everything , I have to know how things work, usually by breaking them to see if they can be fixed.  I've been playing at building sites for years but only at a hobbyist level, it would be nice not to have to crib the funkier work of others and code the trickier bits (JavaScript) from scratch, so my aims for the course are:
1. Learn through collaboration;
2. Pick up a better understanding of modern tools & techniques for web development; and,
3. Move towards a more profession way of developing sites.

### What makes me Happy?
Obviously I have to say my family , but I do like to sneak away for a round of golf when circumstances permit.

_So thats me ..._
